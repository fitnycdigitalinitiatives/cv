            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="lead">Thank you for visiting my online Tenure & Promotion Portfolio. This portfolio has been compiled as part of my application for Certificate of Continuous Employment to the Tenure & Promotion Committee at the Fashion Institute of Technology in 2018. In this portfolio, the Committee will find documentation of my contributions as an adjunct faculty member to FIT. Throughout the full range of my work—from Digital Projects, Service to the College, and Professional Activity—the Committee will gather an accurate impression of my value to the College.
            </p>
            <p>
              I joined the Gladys Marcus Library as the Digital Initiatives Librarian in May 2015. In this role, I am responsible for overseeing and directing library initiatives involving both digital content and metadata. Working from professional standards and best practices, I am responsible for formulating policies and procedures for all parts of the digital content lifecycle: production, management, description, access and preservation. In fulfilling these responsibilities, I have undertaken and managed numerous digital projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my primary responsibilities, as a faculty memeber, I serve on various teams, committees, and working groups throughout the Library and College. In this capacity, I have contributed to the governance and strategic planning of the Library and College. This essential work with colleagues across the Library and College is very rewarding, and has often resulted in furthering my goals on digital initiatives through collaboration. Finally, as a library professional, I am an active member of my field. I attend numerous conferences and workshops, while keeping up-to-date on the relevant topics in my field. For additional professional experience, please review my <a target="_blank" href="images/anderson_resume.pdf">resume</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for your consideration.

            <h3>Digital Projects</h3>
            <p class="lead">In my primary function as the Digital Initiatives Librarian, I have undertaken numerous digital projects with the objective of delivering FIT Library resources in new ways to the FIT community, as well as to new audiences.</p>
            <p>An additional and necessary aim of these projects is to organize, manage and preserve our growing array of digital content. As the Library continues to evolve into the 21st century, an increasing amount of digital content is being created by the Library and FIT itself rather than collected primarily from third parties. Integral in the creation of new digital content is the responsibility to steward it to future generations. Along with overseeing the practical aspects of this digital content lifecycle, I have also sought to create websites and user interfaces that reflect the creativity of the FIT brand and provide users with novel ways of discovering content.</p>
            <p>To develop these projects, I have collaborated with colleagues across the Library and the College. I have worked closely FIT Information Technology (IT) to set up servers to host and maintain these projects. I have worked with a variety of open-source applications and numerous coding languages, which has created less reliance on costly third-party hosting. When working with teams, I have utilized project management tools to create more efficient workflows and accountability. Throughout, a growing web presence has been built for the FIT Library and with each new project proof that we can continue to grow further.</p>

              <h4>SPARC Digital</br><a target="_blank" href="https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu"><small class="text-muted">sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu</small></a></h4>
              <a target="_blank" href="https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu"><img src="images/sparc_digital_homepage1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="SPARC Digital Homepage"></a>
              <p class="lead">"SPARC Digital is a platform created by the FIT Library's Special Collections and College Archives to showcase the rare and unique materials from our collections that have been digitized. Our goal is to make our collections more widely available online to the FIT community and the general public."</p>
              <div class="entry">
                <p>Background: Previous to the launch of SPARC Digital, the FIT Library's Special Collections and College Archives (SPARC) did not have a dedicated platform for its digitized materials. A small portion of their digitized images (over 2000 images) had been uploaded to FITDIL, the library's general purpose digital image library. FITDIL, however, is primarily intended for usage within the FIT community, and its general nature limits its ability to showcase the uniqueness of SPARC's materials.</p>
                <p>SPARC Digital was thus conceived as a platform that would not only showcase digitized materials, but also allow us to tell the stories of these materials through online exhibitions. In addition, we wanted to offer users the ability to navigate these collections by color, which is a feature that is being seen more and more in online collections. When a user views on an image on SPARC Digital, they will see a series of swatches that indicate the predominant colors that make up that image, and by clicking on one of those color swatches, the site will return all the images that share that color. Finally, we wanted to design a site and user experience that reflected the elegant aesthetics of the materials.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Oversaw launch of SPARC Digital on 10/2/2017 with nearly 2500 images and 2 online exhibitions, with new content being added frequently</li>
                  <li>Created custom 'feed' to feature "Image of the Week" on FIT Newsroom</li>
                  <li>Updated underlying code to be compliant with accessibility standards</li>
                  <li>Created <a target="_blank" href="images/sparc_flyer.jpg">promotional flyer</a> for publicizing launch of website on social media</li>
                  <li>Added capability to download high resolution images of Public Domain items, <a target="_blank" href="https://sparcdigital.fitnyc.edu/items/show/2879">e.g.</a></li>

              <p class="lead">"Archive on Demand is a new online video platform created by the FIT Library. Our goal is to make videos of lectures and events that occur on campus available online to the FIT community and the general public. This online video resource is a wonderful way to increase access to some of the lectures, events, exhibitions, and instruction happening at FIT and share them with a wider audience."</p>
              <div class="entry">
                <p>Background: FIT holds numerous lectures, events and exhibitions that have been recorded over the years, and in practice these videos are shared with the FIT Community and general public through various YouTube channels held by departments across the College. The idea behind Archive on Demand is to curate and aggregate these videos onto a single platform. Along with being a single point of access for users, Archive on Demand also serves as a means of organizing, describing, and preserving the College's video assets. In addition, with Archive on Demand as point of distribution, the site has been instrumental in reshaping and improving video workflows on campus.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Oversaw relaunch and total redesign of Archive on Demand (4/2016), moving from Wordpress to Omeka application</li>
                  <li>Have added over 200 additional videos since relaunching</li>
                  <li>Worked to create OAI-PMH link between Archive on Demand and WorldCat Digital Collection Gateway to automate the addition of bibliographic records for AOD videos to WorldCat</li>
                  <li>Produced Archive on Demand <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzw0YfImyBTQaHIxYllqRTJ5dm8/view?usp=sharing">promotional video</a> and <a target="_blank" href="images/card_proof.pdf">business cards</a> for Convocation, 2016</li>
                  <li>Developed guidelines for promotion of video content on social media</li>
                  <li>Developed new <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/a/fitnyc.edu/document/d/1aWr35Xni-VU1PKG9BmUxPijhqcs3ZqVIaI9jzQAUtmg/edit?usp=sharing">metadata guidelines</a></li>

              <div class="entry">
                <p>Background: both SPARC Digital and Archive on Demand are built with the application Omeka, and while this application offers many advantages for managing digital collections, it is lacking in its search functionality. Using a plugin for this application, we are able to integrate the search platform, Solr, into these sites. To do so, I worked closely with IT to set up a dedicated Solr server. In addition, I customized the plugin to work with the most up-to-date version of the Solr application as well to work best with our particular sites. Now our sites have the ability to search with relevance ranking and to return faceted results, a minimum standard for today's user.</p>

                <p>Background: Based on the several digital projects that I have worked on at FIT, I was approached by Professor Anna Blume to work on a collaborative digital humanities project between members of the Library and the History of Art Department. Professor Blume has conducted significant research into Native American bannerstones, and seeks to share the results with her peers and general public in the spirit of Open Access. When launched, this site will allow users not only to browse and search the content, but to download full resolution images and research data.</p>

              <div class="entry">
                <p>Background: With SPARC Connect, I was not involved with the initial conception and planning of the project, as I have been with others. The Special Collections and College Archives was in need of an online database to organize its archival holdings due to the fact that this information was being documented on spreadsheets, a process that is falling out of practice in the profession. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/">Atom</a>, a popular application within the archival profession, was selected for this purpose, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artefactual.com/">Artefactual Systems</a>, the application developer, was contracted to host this service for SPARC. It was at this point that I became involved in the project. Working with SPARC, I customized the site's default theme and user interface to better reflect the FIT brand and engage our users. After completing design and working with Artefactual Systems to implement the theme, I took over management of the site for several months due to a staffing vacancy in SPARC.</p>

                <p>Background: Web archiving is a developing practice in the archives and library profession that involves the collection and preservation of web pages. Whereas traditional media are generally static, web archiving poses the challenge of dealing with materials that are highly dynamic. Along with several colleagues, we have led the effort to begin to archive FIT's web presence, exploring the tools <a target="_blank" href="https://archive-it.org/">Archive-It</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://webrecorder.io/">Webrecorder</a>.</p>

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p class="lead">Across all of my duties as a faculty member at FIT and my professional activities as a librarian, I am constantly exposed to new technologies and developments in the profession that may be of great benefit to the FIT Library. To this end, implementing new digital initiatives requires balancing the necessity and feasibility of each project. But because necessity and feasibility change over time, I feel it is important to keep a set of goals that includes projects that are immediate and achievable and also those that are less realizable. In addition to changing context, my own development as a professional, as well as the colleagues that I have collaborated with, continue to open the door to new initiatives that once seemed out of reach.</p>
