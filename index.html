            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="lead">Thank you for visiting my Tenure & Promotion Portfolio. This portfolio has been compiled as part of my application for Certificate of Continuous Employment to the Fashion Institute of Technology in 2018. In this portfolio, the T&P Committee will find complete documentation of my contributions and service as an adjunct faculty member to FIT.
            </p>
            <p>
              I joined the Gladys Marcus Library as the Digital Initiatives Librarian in May 2015. In this role, I am responsible for overseeing and directing library initiatives involving both digital content and metadata. Working from professional standards and best practices, I am responsible for formulating policies and procedures for all parts of the digital content lifecycle: production, management, description, access and preservation. In fulfilling these responsibilities, I have undertaken and managed numerous digital projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to my primary responsibilities, as a faculty member I serve on various teams, committees, and working groups throughout the Library and College. In this capacity, I have made valuable contributions to governance and strategic planning. This essential work with colleagues across the Library and College is very rewarding, and has led to cross-disciplinary digital initiatives that benefit FIT and the greater community. Finally, as a library professional, I am an active member of my field. I attend numerous conferences and workshops, while keeping up-to-date on the relevant topics in my field. For additional professional experience, please review my <a target="_blank" href="images/anderson_resume.pdf">resume</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for your consideration.

            <h3>Digital Projects</h3>
            <p class="lead">In my primary function as the Digital Initiatives Librarian, I have undertaken numerous digital projects with the objective of delivering FIT Library resources in new ways to the FIT community, as well as to reach new audiences beyond traditional boundaries.</p>
            <p>An additional and necessary aim of these projects is to organize, manage and preserve our growing array of digital content. As the Library continues to evolve into the 21st century, an increasing amount of digital content is being created by the Library and the College, itself, rather than collected primarily from third parties. Integral in the creation of new digital content is the responsibility to steward it to future generations. Along with overseeing the practical aspects of this digital content lifecycle, I have also sought to create websites and user interfaces that reflect the creativity of the FIT brand and provide users with novel ways of discovering content. These sites not only showcase unique, exciting content, but FIT itself.</p>
            <p>To develop these projects, I have collaborated with colleagues across the Library and the College. I have worked closely FIT Information Technology (IT) to set up servers to host and maintain these projects. I have worked with a variety of open-source applications and numerous coding languages, which has created less reliance on costly third-party hosting. When working with teams, I have utilized project management tools to create more efficient workflows and accountability. Throughout, a growing web presence has been built for the Library and the College, and with each new project proof that we can continue to grow further.</p>

              <p class="lead">"SPARC Digital is a platform created by the FIT Library's Special Collections & College Archives to showcase the rare and unique materials from our collections that have been digitized. Our goal is to make our collections more widely available online to the FIT community and the general public."</p>
              <div class="entry">
                <p>Background: Prior to the launch of SPARC Digital, the FIT Library's Special Collections & College Archives (SPARC) did not have a dedicated platform for its digitized materials. A small portion of their digitized images (over 2000 images of original fashion sketches and photographs) had been uploaded to FITDIL, the library's general purpose digital image library. FITDIL, however, is primarily intended for usage within the FIT community, and its general nature limits its ability to showcase the uniqueness of SPARC's materials.</p>
                <p>SPARC Digital was thus conceived as a platform that would not only showcase digitized materials, but also allow us to tell the stories of these materials through online exhibitions. In addition, we wanted to offer users the ability to navigate these collections by color, which is a feature that is being seen more and more in online collections. When a user views an image on SPARC Digital, they will see a series of swatches that indicate the predominant colors that make up that image, and by clicking on one of those color swatches, the site will return all the images that share that color. Finally, we wanted to design a site and user experience that reflected the elegant aesthetics of the materials, as well as to contribute positively to the public face of FIT.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Oversaw launch of SPARC Digital on 10/2/2017 with nearly 2500 images and 2 online exhibitions, with new content being added frequently</li>

Our goal is to make videos of lectures and events that occur on campus available online to the FIT community and the general public. This online video resource is a wonderful way to increase access to some of the lectures, events, exhibitions, and instruction happening at FIT and share them with a wider audience."</p>
              <div class="entry">
                <p>Background: FIT holds numerous lectures, events and exhibitions that have been recorded over the years, and in practice these videos are shared with the FIT Community and general public through various YouTube channels held by departments across the College. The idea behind Archive on Demand is to curate and aggregate these videos onto a single platform. Along with being a single point of access for users, Archive on Demand also serves as a means of organizing, describing, and preserving the College's video assets. In addition, with Archive on Demand as point of distribution, the site has been instrumental in reshaping and improving video workflows on campus.</p>

                <p>Background: both SPARC Digital and Archive on Demand are built with the application, Omeka, and while this application offers many advantages for managing digital collections, it is lacking in its search functionality. Using a plugin for this application, we are able to integrate the search platform, Solr, into these sites. To do so, I worked closely with IT to set up a dedicated Solr server. In addition, I customized the plugin to work with the most up-to-date version of the Solr application as well as to work best with our particular sites. When fully integrated, the sites will have the ability to search with relevance ranking and to return faceted results, a minimum standard for today's user.</p>

The department decided to adopt an archival management system as a much-needed upgrade to the process of documenting their archival holdings on spreadsheets, a method that is falling out of practice in the profession. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.accesstomemory.org/en/">AtoM</a>, a popular application within the archival profession, was selected for this purpose, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.artefactual.com/">Artefactual Systems</a>, the application developer, was contracted to host this service for SPARC. Working with SPARC, I customized the site's default theme and user interface to better reflect the FIT brand and engage our users. After completing the design and working with Artefactual Systems to implement the theme, I took over management of the site for several months, due to a staffing vacancy in SPARC, and readied the site for launch.

                <p>Background: A team was formed in 2016 to explore the feasibility of digitizing the library's <a target="_blank" href="http://fitnyc.libguides.com/forecastcollection">Historical Forecast Collection</a>. The team met for several months, pursuing several strategies, scanning sample forecasts, and developing a prototype website, but eventually it was decided that the project was not feasible at this time. There is still a possibility that parts of this project will form the basis of an online exhibition for SPARC Digital.</p>

              <h4>Open Source Contributions</h4>
              <p>In the spirit Open Source and Open Access, I publish all the code for the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fitnycdigitalinitiatives">digital projects</a> I have contributed to (including this portfolio) on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. GitHub is a platform that hosts code repositories for millions of users, and facilitates sharing, collaboration, and reuse of Open Source projects. As I have used the code of other developers to bring projects to fruition, so others can do the same with my contributions.</p>

            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <p class="lead">Across all of my duties as a faculty member at FIT and my professional activities as a librarian, I am constantly exposed to new technologies and developments in the profession that may be of great benefit to the College. To this end, implementing new digital initiatives requires balancing the necessity and feasibility of each project. As I weigh these elements, my growth as a professional, along with the rich, collaborative environment afforded by FIT, continues to open the door to new initiatives that I look forward to exploring.</p>
